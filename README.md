# you will need to change the linking to libtiff.so in src folder
# command: within src folder, run dc_shell-t -f
# ../synth/AND8.tcl. AND8.tcl records all the setup tcl commands. 

# source the EE271 setup script for the design compiler tool. Notice that
# all the EE tools are on the afs.... we will have to move the tool chain
